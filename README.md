# QuizCap-Android Application

QuizCap is an Android application that allows a student to takes notes of their typed notes, and automatically create a Quizlet set from those notes.
It makes use of the following technologies:

# Be aware!

  - The app is not properly scaled yet, so the UI is currently clunky.
